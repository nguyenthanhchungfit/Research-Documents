plugins {
    // Apply the java-library plugin to add support for Java Library
    id 'java-library'
}
=> The build script adds the java-library plugin. This is an extension of the java-base plugin and adds additional 
    tasks for compiling Java source code


* Customize the library JAR
    You will often want the name of the JAR file to include the library version.
        version = '0.1.0'

    Another common requirement is customizing the manifest file, typically by adding one or more attributes. 
    Let’s include the library name and version in the manifest file by configuring the jar task. \
        jar {
            manifest {
                attributes('Implementation-Title': project.name,
                                'Implementation-Version': project.version)
            }
        }

    $ jar xf build/libs/demo-0.1.0.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF : view MANIFEST

* Adding API documentation
    The java-library plugin has built-in support for Java’s API documentation tool via the javadoc task.
    The code generated by the Build Init plugin already placed a comment on the Library.java file. Modify the comment to become javadoc markup.

    $ ./gradlew javadoc
    => view the generated javadoc files by opening the HTML file located at build/docs/javadoc/index.html
