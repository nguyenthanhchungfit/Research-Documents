* Command Line Editing
    bash uses a library (a shared collection of routines that different programs can use) 
        called Readline to implement command line editing.
    Note: Some of the key sequences below (particularly those which use the Alt key)may be 
        intercepted by the GUI for other functions. All of the key sequences shouldwork properly 
        when using a virtual console
    
    * Cursor Movement
        Table 8-1: Cursor Movement 
            CommandsKey         Action
            Ctrl-a          Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
            Ctrl-e          Move cursor to the end of the line.
            Ctrl-f          Move cursor forward one character; same as the right arrow key.
            Ctrl-b          Move cursor backward one character; same as the left arrow key.
            Alt-f           Move cursor forward one word.
            Alt-b           Move cursor backward one word.
            Ctrl-l          Clear the screen and move the cursor to the top left corner. The clear command does the same thin

    * Modifying Text
        Table 8-2: Text Editing Commands
            Key                 Action
            Ctrl-d          Delete the character at the cursor location
            Ctrl-t          Transpose (exchange) the character at the cursor location with the one preceding it.
            Alt-t           Transpose the word at the cursor location with the one preceding it.
            Alt-l           Convert the characters from the cursor location to the end of the word to lowercase.
            Alt-u           Convert the characters from the cursor location to the end of the word to uppercas

    * Cutting And Pasting
        The Readline documentation uses the terms killing and yanking to refer to what 
        we would commonly call cutting and pasting. Items that are cut are stored in a 
        buffer called the killring
        Table 8-3: Cut And Paste Commands
            Key                 Action
            Ctrl-k          Kill text from the cursor location to the end of line.
            Ctrl-u          Kill text from the cursor location to the beginning of the line.
            Alt-d           Kill text from the cursor location to the end of the current word.
            Alt-Backspace   Kill text from the cursor location to the beginning of the current word. If the cursor is 
                                at the beginning of a word, kill the previous word.
            Ctrl-y          Yank text from the kill-ring and insert it at the cursor location.

        NOTE: ALT work, which special key: (Fn key)

* Completion
    Tab key to complete the command 
    Table 8-4: Completion Commands
        Key                     Action
        Alt-?               Display list of possible completions. On most systems you can also 
                                do this by pressing the tab key a second time, which is much easier.
        Alt-*               Insert all possible completions. This is useful when you want to use 
                                more than one possible matc
* Using History
    This list of commands is kept in your home directory in a file called ".bash_history".
    $ history | grep /usr/bin
    $ !564 => view cmd history 
    Ctrl-r: open search history bash
        Enter: To execute that history cmd
        Ctrl-j: To copy command to terminal
    
    Table 8-5: History Commands
        Key                     Action
        Ctrl-p              Move to the previous history entry. Same action as the up arrow.
        Ctrl-n              Move to the next history entry. Same action as the down arrow.
        Alt-<               Move to the beginning (top) of the history list.
        Alt->               Move to the end (bottom) of the history list, i.e., the current command line.
        Ctrl-r              Reverse incremental search. Searches incrementally from the current command line up the history list.
        Alt-p               Reverse search, non-incremental. With this key, type in the search string and press enter before the search is performed.
        Alt-n               Forward search, non-incremental.
        Ctrl-o              Execute the current item in the history list and advance to the 
                                next one. This is handy if you are trying to re-execute a sequence 
                                of commands in the history list
        
    * History Expansion
        The shell offers a specialized type of expansion for items in the history list by 
            using the“!” character. We have already seen how the exclamation point can be 
            followed by anumber to insert an entry from the history list. 
            There are a number of other expansion feature

        Table 8-6: History Expansion Commands
            Sequence                Action
            !!                  Repeat the last command. It is probably easier to press up arrow andenter.
            !number             Repeat history list item number.
            !string             Repeat last history list item starting with string. 
            !?string            Repeat last history list item containing string.

        !!NOTE: I would caution against using the “!string” and “!?string” forms unless you are absolutel 
                sure of the contents of the history list item
